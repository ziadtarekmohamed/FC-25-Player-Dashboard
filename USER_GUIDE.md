## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### 🎯 Effective Filtering
1. **Start broad, then narrow**: Begin with position or team, then add more filters
2. **Use age ranges**: Find young talents (16-21) or experienced players (30+)
3. **Combine filters**: Search for "Spanish midfielders over 85 OVR"

### 📊 Analysis Tips
1. **Compare similar positions**: CBs vs CBs, not CB vs ST
2. **Use radar charts**: Quickly identify player types (pace vs technique)
3. **Check correlations**: Understand which attributes work together

### 🔍 Search Strategies
1. **Partial names work**: "Messi" finds "Lionel Messi"
2. **Try variations**: "Man United" vs "Manchester United"
3. **Use filters first**: Narrow down before detailed search

### 📈 Performance Optimization
1. **Apply filters early**: Reduces processing time
2. **Close unused tabs**: Keeps browser responsive
3. **Download results**: Save interesting findings
